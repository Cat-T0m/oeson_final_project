Official final project for the OESON Data Science training and internship program. This is a image classification project. Four categories, between 8k and 9k images per class. 
The archive contains the folder structure necessary to run the analysis. The python files starting with "split_" are meant to create the training and test folders for the VGG and Inception algorithms. The data unfortunately couldn't fit in. The data needs to be placed into the subfolders of the data folder accordingly.
